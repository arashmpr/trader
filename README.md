# Trading Reinforcement Learning Agent

For simplicity this code is going to be improved over time. A dear friend of mine said to me that a person set his goal to only writing 5-6 lines of code each day and now he has build a giant engine search application. That is the idea here. Also, I want to improve my technical writing as well.

For starters, I will have the following classes:
1. Agent: This is where I will define my agent's action space and my agent's class and it's abilities
2. Env: It's supposed to create the environment of my agent, some of it's responsibilities are gathering the data and preprocessing them.
3. TA: This is going to be my technical analysis class, I've been reading the "Zero to Hero" book which is in the references. (Take a look at it, it's amazing) and I am going to use the most important technical analysis methods here, to calculate them and implement them.
4. Candle Stick Patterns: Here i will implement the most recurring candle stick patterns that might come in handy to predict
5. Chart Patterns: Same as candle stick patterns but for charts.

I believe that this is it for now.

The coins I want to take into consideration:
[BTC, BNB, DOGE, ETH, XRP, SOL]

In the future, I will be keeping abreast with the reinforcement learning papers in the field of crypto trading and use them in my code.
